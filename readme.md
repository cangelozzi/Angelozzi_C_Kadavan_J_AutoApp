### Project Outline
Each team will develop a responsive mobile-first application to showcase an
interactive implementation of your design. Please note that this means that you can
consider how the graphics and interactivity evolve as a web app.
Start with a splash page with a “hero shot” - but use a video produced in 3001
instead. See the provided example as a reference. Include some UI elements for
navigation - you’ll need to move from this page to an interactive “details” page that
showcases selected features. The “details” page should also have controls to
navigate and view product details.
